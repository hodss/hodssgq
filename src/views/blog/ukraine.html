<h1>The Russian Invasion of Ukraine</h1>

    Unless you've been living under a rock (or you're in a country that banned you from hearing this news) there has been an invasion of Ukraine, no it's not to remove those in power because they are breaking laws or something like it. Russia has invaded Ukraine, fully, attacked civilians, brutally shelled cities like Mariupol, Kiev, Kharkiv, and many, many more. 6,000 civilians have been killed, that number is large enough for anyone to be in disbelief, but trust me friends this is not fake, and I want to help people learn about this and why it happened.

    This is an update on the situation.
    <br> <br>
    Today is the ninth day of the fourth month, of the two thousanth and twenty-second year.
      <br> <br>
      I have been debating about making something about this for quite a while since it's become something quite horrific indeed. I recommend you to stop reading if you're not ready to hear more about what's happened in Bucha. You have been warned.
      <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

      In Bucha, Russian soldiers have committed all that I can say is genocide. They have set up a system where they take, children, women, men, elderly, anyone, and put a bullet in their head. Sound similar to something else? Well it is. If they discover more situations like this, shooting civilians, raping women. This is period a war crime, no, it's a crime against humanity. This is so fucked up that the Russians deny this. Russia was expelled from the United Nations Human Rights Council, and then had the audacity to say that they quit it anyways moments after having been expelled. What needs to happen is the immediate removal of Russia from the UN Security Council, China and Russian have VETO power, but France, the US, and the UK need to act better. I'm not a diplomat, but based on my research, yes there will be outrage, but THIS is the exact reason that this needs to happen. Or, if you can't remove a permanent member, which can make sense, some form of suspension should be available at the dispense of the UN General Assembly.
